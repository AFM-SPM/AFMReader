# Introduction

AFMReader is a [Python](https://www.python.org) package for loading Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) image files. It is
primarily used by the [TopoStats](https://AFM-SPM.github.io/TopoStats) package for loading AFM images for
processing. Both AFMReader and packages are written and maintained by members of the [Pyne
Lab](https://pyne-lab.uk/bio/) based at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk).
